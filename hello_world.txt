I see oceans of blue,
red strings too.
I see them in vim,
for me and for you. 
And I echo to myself,
"hello, world."

I see oceans of blue,
And clouds of white.
Serving content day in,
and all through the night.
And I echo to myself,
"hello, world."

The color scheme of vim, 
So pretty in the shell.
Is also the state,
Of geeks scripting by. 

I see hosts shaking hands, 
Saying "how do you do?"
They're really saying,
"I'll establish with you"  

I hear interns cry,
I watch them grow,
They'll learn to use Google,
more than I can show. 
And I echo to myself,
"hello, world."

Yes, I echo to myself,
"hello, world."
